# UI Improvements Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Mode Picker Sticky Effect Fix
- Added `lastSentMode` state variable to track the last mode sent to server
- Only sends mode change when it's different from the last sent mode
- Increased initialization delay to 0.2 seconds
- Width increased from 300 to 350 pixels

### 2. Start/Stop Button Enhancement
- Width doubled to 120 pixels for better visibility
- Button now has fixed width frame

### 3. Camera View Improvements
- Added 20px horizontal padding on both sides
- Axis lines (x=0, y=0) thickness increased from 2 to 3 pixels
- Coordinate labels now show specific values: -0.4, -0.3, -0.25, -0.2, -0.15, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4
- Zero coordinate shows as "0" instead of "0.00"

### 4. Autonomous Mode Status Display
- Shows "Target Detected" or "No Target Detection"
- BBox Error format: "(x_error, y_error)" or "no detection"
- Filtered Error format: "(x_error, y_error)" or "no detection"
- Removed redundant text, cleaner layout

### 5. Camera View Overlay Updates
- Shows "no detection" when there's no bounding box or filtered data
- Added error info display at bottom left corner showing:
  - BBox Error
  - Filtered Error
- Both top-left info and bottom-left error displays update in real-time

### 6. Target Offset Control Layout
- Slider width limited to 200px to provide more space for text
- Text now has adequate space without wrapping

### 7. PID Controls in Autonomous Mode
- Added full PID control panels for both Pitch and Yaw
- Same functionality as in Auto Aim mode
- Initializes values from system state when synchronized

### 8. ESC and Launch Button Improvements (Manual & Auto Aim)
- ESC slider shows only current value (no bounds)
- Removed redundant "Value:" text below slider
- ESC Reset and LAUNCH! buttons placed horizontally
- Reset button takes 1/3 width, LAUNCH! button takes 2/3 width
- Both buttons have same height (44px)
- Removed "Launch Control" group box label

### 9. Launch Button Animation
- Shows progress fill animation during 1-second trigger period
- Button becomes disabled and semi-transparent (0.7 opacity) while launching
- Orange progress bar fills from left to right over 1 second
- Automatically re-enables after trigger sequence completes

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Used local state variables to prevent race conditions in mode picker
- Added `isLaunching` and `launchProgress` states for launch animation
- Proper synchronization checks before sending commands

### Layout Optimization
- Consistent spacing and padding throughout
- Proper frame constraints for responsive design
- GeometryReader used for progress animation

### Visual Feedback
- Clear color coding: yellow for BBox, green for filtered, red for target
- Opacity variations for "no detection" states
- Smooth animations for launch progress

All changes maintain the existing functionality while significantly improving the user experience and visual clarity of the interface.
