# Fixes Implemented

## 1. Log Display Moved to Header
- Removed log overlay from camera view
- Added log display to HeaderView with orange background
- Shows as a horizontal bar below the main header controls
- Only visible when there's a log message

## 2. Start/Stop Button Width Increased
- Changed width from 120px to 200px for better visibility
- Button is now much more prominent

## 3. Connection and Query Handling Improved
- Added 0.5 second delay after connection before sending query
- Reset synchronization state on disconnect/reconnect
- Added retry logic for query sending if it fails
- Properly handle all connection states (connecting, connected, disconnected, failed)

## 4. Target Offset Control Visibility
- Control is now always visible, even when disconnected
- Sliders and buttons are disabled when not connected
- Opacity reduced to 0.6 when disconnected for visual feedback
- Send button requires both connection and synchronization

## 5. ESC Control and Running State
- ESC automatically set to zero when stop is called
- ESC value resets to zero in UI when stopped
- All controls disabled when not running:
  - Servo pitch/yaw sliders
  - ESC slider
  - Reset button
  - LAUNCH! button

## 6. Configuration Sending on Start
- When Start button is pressed, sends all configuration:
  - maxConsecutiveNans
  - targetX/Y (from settingsStore)
  - stopThrottle
  - motorOffset  
  - defaultSpeed
  - cutoffFrequency
- If in AutoAim or Autonomous mode, also sends:
  - Pitch P/I values
  - Yaw P/I values

## Connection Bug Fixes
The "Connection reset by peer" error in the dummy server is likely due to the server not properly handling client disconnections. The client now handles this gracefully by:
- Detecting the error and updating connection state
- Allowing reconnection attempts
- Properly resetting synchronization state

## UI State Management
- Controls properly reflect connection and running states
- Visual feedback through opacity and disabled states
- Automatic value resets when appropriate
