# Connection Management Fix

## Issue
When the connect button is pressed multiple times (especially when server is not available), it creates multiple connection attempts. When the server eventually comes online, it accepts all these connections, causing:
- Multiple connections from same client (different ports)
- Synchronization getting stuck
- Confusion about which connection to use

## Root Cause
1. No protection against multiple simultaneous connection attempts
2. Connect button could be clicked rapidly
3. Existing connections were not properly canceled before starting new ones

## Solution Implemented

### 1. NetworkManager Protection
- Added `isConnecting` flag to track connection state
- Check if already connecting/connected before starting new connection
- Cancel any existing connection before starting new one
- Properly reset `isConnecting` flag in all error/timeout scenarios

### 2. UI Protection
- Disable connect button while in "connecting" state
- Prevents rapid clicking that creates multiple connections

### 3. Debug Logging
- Added logging when connection attempts are ignored
- Added logging when existing connections are canceled

## Benefits
- Prevents multiple simultaneous connections
- Cleaner connection management
- No more stuck synchronization due to multiple connections
- Better user experience with disabled button during connection

## Testing
1. Try clicking connect button rapidly - should only create one connection
2. Try connecting when server is down, then start server - should connect cleanly
3. Connection failures should properly reset state for retry
