# Robust Reconnection Fix

## Issue
The client wasn't properly reconnecting after connection failures:
- `nw_endpoint_flow_failed_with_error` errors
- Connection attempts stopping after initial failure
- VPN interface (utun5) causing connection issues

## Root Causes
1. Timer not scheduled on main thread
2. Connection object not properly cleaned up
3. Interface type restriction causing issues
4. Receive errors not triggering reconnection

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Timer Scheduling
- Moved timer creation to main thread using `DispatchQueue.main.async`
- Ensures timer is properly scheduled on the run loop

### 2. Connection Cleanup
- Set `connection = nil` after failures
- Properly reset connection state before reconnection
- Clean up on receive errors

### 3. Interface Flexibility
- Removed `params.requiredInterfaceType = .other`
- Allows connection over any available interface (Wi-Fi, VPN, etc.)

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added reconnection on receive errors
- Added reconnection when server closes connection
- Proper cleanup in all error scenarios

### 5. Debug Logging
- Added detailed logging for all state changes
- Shows reconnection attempts and failures
- Helps diagnose connection issues

## Result
- Connection automatically retries every 0.5s after failure
- Works across different network interfaces
- Properly handles all error scenarios
- No more stuck states
