# Simplified Synchronization Approach

## Changes Made

### Previous Approach (Issues)
- Used a repeating sync timer that sent Query packets every 0.2 seconds
- Kept sending queries even if server wasn't responding
- Could cause excessive network traffic
- Debug logs showed continuous "Sync query sent, waiting for CurrentState..." messages

### New Approach (Simplified)
1. When connected to server, send a single Query packet
2. Wait for server to respond with CurrentState packet
3. If query fails, retry after 1 second
4. Once CurrentState is received, mark as synchronized
5. Start regular query timer (5Hz) for periodic updates

## Benefits
- Reduces network traffic during initial connection
- Cleaner logs - only shows "Initial sync query sent" once
- If server doesn't respond, client will retry intelligently
- More aligned with typical client-server patterns

## Debug Features Added
- NetworkManager now logs all received packets: "Received packet: [type]"
- SystemStateManager logs packet processing: "SystemStateManager processing packet: [type]"
- Clear indication when CurrentState is processed

## Troubleshooting
If synchronization still fails:
1. Check server logs to ensure it's sending CurrentState in response to Query
2. Look for "Received packet: Current State" in client logs
3. Verify packet format matches between client and server
4. Ensure server is actually processing Query packets
