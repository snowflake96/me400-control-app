# Mode Synchronization Fix

## Problem
When the client selected AutoAim or Autonomous mode, the mode would revert back to Manual mode even though the server received the mode change correctly.

## Root Cause
The issue was a race condition:
1. Client sends SetMode packet to server (e.g., AutoAim)
2. Client updates its local state to AutoAim
3. Client immediately starts querying server every 0.5 seconds
4. Server responds with CurrentState packet, but hasn't processed the SetMode yet
5. CurrentState contains mode=Manual, which overwrites client's mode back to Manual

## Solution
Modified `NSystemStateManager.swift` to only update the driving mode from server packets during initial synchronization. After initial sync, the client maintains its own mode state based on UI interactions.

### Implementation
In `processCurrentState()`:
```swift
// Check if this is initial sync
let isInitialSync = !hasSynchronized

updateState { state in
    // Only update mode during initial synchronization
    // After that, the client controls the mode through UI
    if isInitialSync {
        if let drivingMode = DrivingMode(rawValue: mode) {
            state.drivingMode = drivingMode
        }
    }
    
    // ... rest of state updates
}
```

## Benefits
- Client UI remains responsive and consistent
- No race conditions between client mode changes and server responses
- Server still tracks its own mode state independently
- Initial synchronization ensures client starts with correct server state

## Testing
1. Connect to server
2. Switch to AutoAim mode - mode should stay as AutoAim
3. Switch to Autonomous mode - mode should stay as Autonomous
4. Switch back to Manual mode - mode should stay as Manual
5. Disconnect and reconnect - mode should sync with server's current mode
