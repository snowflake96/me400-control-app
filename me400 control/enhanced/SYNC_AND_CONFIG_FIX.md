# Synchronization and Configuration Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Wrong Configuration Values
- **Issue**: Client was using old timeout values (10s, 2s, 5 attempts)
- **Cause**: `SettingsStore.createNetworkConfiguration()` had hardcoded old values
- **Fix**: Updated to use new values (1s, 0.5s, 20 attempts)

### 2. Synchronization Getting Stuck
- **Issue**: Client showed "Synchronizing..." despite receiving CurrentState
- **Cause**: Synchronization state not properly reset after failed connections
- **Fix**: Added `resetSynchronization()` method to cleanly reset sync state

## Changes Made

### SettingsStore (NME400App.swift)
```swift
connectionTimeout: 1.0,    // Was 10.0
reconnectDelay: 0.5,       // Was 2.0
maxReconnectAttempts: 20,  // Was 5
```

### SystemStateManager
- Added `resetSynchronization()` method
- Resets only sync flags without losing connection data
- Called on connection failures and setup

### ControlCoordinator
- Calls `resetSynchronization()` on failures
- Ensures clean sync state before setup
- Added comprehensive debug logging

## Debug Logging Added

1. **Connection Flow**
   - Connection state changes
   - Synchronization setup timing

2. **Sync Process**
   - Initial sync detection
   - Callback registration
   - Callback execution

3. **State Management**
   - Sync state resets
   - Packet processing flow

## Result
- Faster reconnection (0.5s intervals)
- Reliable synchronization after reconnects
- Clear debug trail for issues
