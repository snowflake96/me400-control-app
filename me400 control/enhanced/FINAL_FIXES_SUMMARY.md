# Final Fixes Summary

## Date: Dec 2024

### 1. System Settings Initialization ✅

**Solution Implemented**:
- Added 0.1s delay after synchronization to ensure server values are fully populated
- Changed `initializeFromSystemState()` to use direct system state values (not server prefixed ones)
- Server values are now properly set during initial sync in `NSystemStateManager`

**Result**: System settings now show actual server values after connection, not hardcoded defaults.

### 2. Target Offset Initialization ✅

**Problem**: Target offset sliders weren't updating from server values

**Solution**:
- Changed `targetOffsetX` and `targetOffsetY` from `@AppStorage` to `@Published`
- Added connection state handler to reset initialization flag
- Removed local persistence that was overriding server values
- Removed automatic offset sending - only sends when "Send" button is pressed

**Result**: Target offsets properly sync from server on connection, but only update server when user explicitly sends them.

### 3. Log Message Display Updates ✅

**Latest Implementation (v2)**:
- **Layout**: Four equally spaced boxes with vertical dividers
- **Text Size**: Reduced to 2/3 (`.caption` font)
- **Opacity**: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40% gradient
- **Dividers**: Vertical gray lines between messages
- **Empty Slots**: Maintain layout with empty boxes

### 4. Latency Tracking Fix ✅

**Solution**: 
- Moved `setCurrentStateCallback` to `setupSynchronization()`
- Callback is now re-established after each connection
- Ensures latency updates work after disconnect/reconnect

### 5. ServerState Flickering Fix ✅

**Problem**: Values flickered between N/A and actual values during initial connection

**Solution**:
1. Stop sync timer immediately upon synchronization
2. Add `isProcessingSyncPacket` flag to prevent multiple sync packet processing
3. Reorder operations to prevent race conditions

### 6. Settings View Improvements ✅

- Removed unnecessary Target Offset section
- Made server host/port fields non-editable when connected
- Fixed reconnection issue when changing PID step sizes

### 7. Benefits Summary

1. **Stability**: No more UI flickering or race conditions
2. **Consistency**: All values properly synchronized with server
3. **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive log display with aging visualization
4. **Reliability**: Proper cleanup and reconnection handling
5. **Performance**: Optimized query timing and state updates
6. **User Control**: Target offsets only sent when explicitly requested
