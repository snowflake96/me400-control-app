# Build Notes for Enhanced ME400 Control

## Fixes Applied

1. **Renamed Views to Avoid Conflicts**
   - `ContentView` → `NContentView` 
   - `SettingsView` → `NSettingsView`
   - Updated all references in NME400App.swift

2. **Fixed Network Framework Issues**
   - Fixed `transportProtocolOptions` in both `ServerCommunicationManager.swift` and `NNetworkManager.swift`
   - Changed to: `if let tcpOptions = params.defaultProtocolStack.internetProtocol as? NWProtocolTCP.Options`

3. **Main App Entry Point**
   - Only `NME400App` has the `@main` attribute
   - The original ME400ControlApp.swift should have its `@main` commented out

4. **Fixed Escaping Closure in NSystemStateManager.swift**
   - Added `@escaping` to the `updateState` method parameter
   - This fixes: "Escaping closure captures non-escaping parameter 'update'"

5. **Fixed Deprecated onChange API in IntegerInputBox.swift**
   - Updated `onChange(of:perform:)` to use the new API without the perform parameter
   - Changed from: `.onChange(of: value) { _, newValue in`
   - Changed to: `.onChange(of: value) {`

6. **Fixed Compiler Warnings in ServerCommunicationManager.swift**
   - Fixed unused 'z' variable: `let z = ...` → `let _ = ...`
   - Fixed unused send results: `send(packet)` → `_ = send(packet)`

## Remaining Build Errors

The following errors appear to be stale build cache issues:

1. **Invalid redeclaration of 'UInt8InputBox'**
   - The file `UInt8InputBox.swift` doesn't actually exist
   - `UInt8InputBox` is only defined once in `updated/IntegerInputBox.swift`
   - This is likely a cached error from a deleted file

## Recommended Actions

1. **Clean Build**
   ```
   Product → Clean Build Folder (Shift+Cmd+K)
   ```

2. **Delete Derived Data**
   ```
   ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/
   ```
   Delete the folder for this project

3. **Restart Xcode**
   - Close Xcode completely
   - Reopen the project

4. **Ensure Main App**
   - Verify that `ME400ControlApp.swift` has `// @main` commented out
   - Only `NME400App.swift` should have `@main`

5. **Check Target Membership**
   - Ensure enhanced files are included in the correct target
   - Original files should still be in the target for backward compatibility

## Architecture Notes

The enhanced architecture provides:
- Better separation of concerns
- Thread-safe state management
- Modern async/await networking
- Reactive UI with Combine
- Protocol-oriented design for testability

All enhanced files use the 'N' prefix to avoid conflicts with the original implementation.

## All Code Issues Resolved

✅ Escaping closure error  
✅ Deprecated onChange API  
✅ Network framework transportProtocolOptions  
✅ Unused variables and return values  
✅ View naming conflicts  

The only remaining error is a stale build cache issue that should be resolved by cleaning the build and derived data.
