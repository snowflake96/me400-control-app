# Reconnection and UI Fixes

## 1. Connection Timeout Reconnection Fix

### Issue
When trying to connect while server is unavailable:
- Client shows "Connecting..." with grayed-out connect button
- After connection timeout, client gets stuck - no way to reconnect
- Even when server starts, client doesn't automatically reconnect

### Root Cause
The connection timeout handler didn't trigger reconnection attempts like other failure scenarios.

### Solution
Modified `setupConnectionTimeout()` in NetworkManager to:
- Properly trigger `attemptReconnection()` after timeout
- This allows automatic reconnection when server becomes available
- Consistent with other connection failure scenarios

### Benefits
- No more stuck "Connecting..." state
- Automatic reconnection attempts after timeout
- Better user experience when server is temporarily unavailable

## 2. Target Offset Step Buttons

### Added Features
- Added +/- buttons with 0.001 step size to both X and Y offset controls
- Consistent with ESC control design
- Buttons are disabled when not connected

### Y Offset Control
- Added horizontal button layout with value display in center
- Maintains vertical slider functionality
- Step buttons provide precise control

### X Offset Control  
- Added buttons on either side of the slider
- Maintains slider for quick adjustments
- Step buttons for fine-tuning

### Benefits
- More precise control over target offset values
- Easier to make small adjustments
- Consistent UI design across all controls
